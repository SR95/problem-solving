# Welcome to Sagnik Roy's problem solving git repo
This repo simply consists of random problems that I've found over the course of my programming career, that I thought I should remember for the future.
Collection started: 4/1/2020

## Instructions for running any tests for existing problems:

- type `cd {name of language}` (at the moment, only Python has been implemented)
- then `{name of language} main.{filetype of language}`

Example (Python):

- `cd Python`
- `python main.py`

Example (Java):

- `cd Java`
- `javac main.java`
- `java main`

**NOTE**: You will need the corresponding language installed on your device, to run the main file.
